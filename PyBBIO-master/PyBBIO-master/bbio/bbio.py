 PyBBIO - bbio.py - v0.6
 Author: Alexander Hiam - ahiam@marlboro.edu - www.alexanderhiam.com
 Website: https://github.com/alexanderhiam/PyBBIO

 A Python library for hardware IO support on the TI Beaglebone.
 Currently only supporting basic digital and analog IO, but more 
 peripheral support is on the way, so keep checking the Github page
 for updates.
