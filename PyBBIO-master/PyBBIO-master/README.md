PyBBIO is a Python library for Arduino-style hardware IO support on the TI 
Beaglebone. It currently supports basic digital IO through digitalRead() 
and digitalWrite() functions, ADC support through analogRead(), PWM support 
analogWrite() as well as a few utility functions for changing PWM frequency
etc., and an Arduino-style UART interface. SPI and I2C are on the way, so 
keep checking the Github page for updates.

***PyBBIO is not yet fully working with the 3.8 kernel which comes with the BeagleBone
Black and newer Angstrom images. Currently only GPIO, ADC, serial are working.***

#Installing

It is assumed that your Beaglebone is already set up and configured on your network, 
and that you have already SSHed onto it. 

Note that these instructions assume you want PyBBIO/ to live in your home 
directory. This is not a requirement and can be changed as desired. 

The first step is to install the dependencies: 

On Angstrom:

    # opkg update && opkg install curl gcc python-pyserial python-dev
    # curl http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py | python

On Ubuntu:

    # apt-get update && apt-get install curl gcc python-serial python-dev
    # curl http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py | python

Then you'll need to get the code:

    # cd ~
    # git clone git://github.com/alexanderhiam/PyBBIO.git

Now run the install script:

    # cd PyBBIO
    # python setup.py install

PyBBIO should now be installed correctly. Run the blink example to make sure 
all is well:

    # cd examples
    # python blink.py

And confirm that the LEDs next to the Ethernet jack labelled USR2 and USR3 
are blinking back and forth. 

#Updating
I am working as fast as I can to add support for many of the features that 
the Beablebone's AM3359 processor has to offer, so you'll want to make sure 
your version is up to date. Thanks to git this is a very simple process:

    # cd ~/PyBBIO
    # git pull
    # python setup.py install
